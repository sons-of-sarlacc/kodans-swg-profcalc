# Readme

Modified KSWGProfCalc.dat for use with the [SWGEmu](https://www.swgemu.com) launchers bundled Kodan's SWG ProfCalc V4.0 to match the current status of Finalizer.

## Installation

1. In the `SWGEmu Launchpad` folder rename the existing `KSWGProfCalc.dat` to something like `KSWGProfCalc.dat.old` 
2. Download my fixed [KSWGProfCalc.dat](https://github.com/sons-of-sarlacc/kodans-swg-profcalc/blob/main/KSWGProfCalc.dat?raw=true) into the `SWGEmu Launchpad` folder.
